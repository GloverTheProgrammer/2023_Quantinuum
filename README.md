# iQuHack 2023: Quantinuum

## Team Name: Espada

**Project Description:**
In this iQuHack, we will be working on improving the implementation of QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) for solving the Max-Cut problem. Our goal is to test and implement more advanced optimization strategies, such as COBYLA and SPSA, to see if they can improve the performance of the given implementation. The project will involve coding and testing in Python, using the networkx library and other open-source libraries. By the end of the event, we will have a better understanding of the performance of QAOA and a working implementation using advanced optimization strategies.

**Problem:**
The Max-Cut problem is a well-known problem in graph theory and can be described as follows: Imagine you have a big picture with lots of dots (nodes) and lines (edges) connecting some of the dots. The goal is to color some of the dots red and the rest blue in a way that there are as many lines as possible connecting dots of different colors.

**Technologies Used:**
Python
Networkx
Open-source libraries
